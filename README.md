This application is meant to make it more convenient to share and listen to music while in a social event without having to switch phones, or borrow someone's phone to play the music you would like to hear. 
Spotify Jukebox will allow users to start a jukebox and people, who are near the jukebox, with access to the application and a Spotify Account will be able to join and start adding songs to the queue of what is currently playing.
